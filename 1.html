<h2>HTML</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard Markup
language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.

<p style="margin-top :40px;">HTML provides a way to create structured documents with links, citations, and other items,
as well as representing structural meaning for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
etc. <br>And it can be used to embed images and objects and create interactive forms. HTML
is written in the form of HTML elements that are "tags" enclosed in angle brackets within
the web page content. HTML can contain or load scripts such as JavaScript that affect the
behavior of HTML processing devices such as web browsers, and CSS that defines
the appearance and placement of the body and other items. The W3C, co-director of the HTML
and CSS standards, recommends the use of CSS for clear and representative markup.
